# Contact-Management-System-Using-Binary-Search-Tree-In-JAVA
A Java-based Contact Management System using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient storage, retrieval, and deletion of contacts. Supports adding, searching, deleting, and displaying contacts in sorted order. Features a menu-driven interface for user interaction. Ideal for learning data structures and BST operations in Java. 🚀📞
# Contact Management System Using Binary Search Tree in Java

## 📌 Description
A Java-based Contact Management System that utilizes a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to efficiently store, retrieve, delete, and display contact details. The system allows users to:
- **Add** a contact
- **Search** for a contact by name
- **Delete** a contact
- **Display all contacts** in alphabetical order

This project demonstrates practical applications of **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** in managing sorted data and optimizing search operations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Efficient Searching & Sorting** using BST
- **Menu-driven Interface** for ease of use
- **In-Order Traversal** for sorted contact display
- **Case-Insensitive Search & Deletion**
